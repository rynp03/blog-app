    description: `"Can you imagine you are 5 years older than the person who is writing this today?"
      This is exhilarating but you might not be feeling the same. I don’t know how are you feeling right now. But who knows you better than me. I mean you are literally the upgraded version of me which means that you are more experienced, more matured, more sane, more lovable, more responsible and more courageous. 
      I don’t know what are you doing right now or what condition you are in. If I could get a chance to meet you right now i would have hugged you tightly for not giving up and for everything you have gone through for nothing but to evolve.
      I'm writing this to you because I know what I have been through these years. There has been failures, heartbreak, success and milestones encompassing you and I'm sure the future may not have been a cake walk as well.
      But let me assure you that there is nothing to worry about. You have conquered everything from the start and will keep doing it. You always kept moving on when you can barely even stand. The future is unanticipated. No one knows what it has for you but the only thing you can do is just move forward and never ever look back for the reason that it will owe you nothing but dejection apart from the good old memories which you will always cherish in your heart.
      You might not be doing a stable job, your manager and senior might have wound you up at times.Talking about the funny sides your family may have started looking for marriage proposals for you. "Come on be honest isn't it true?" I'm sure no one but at least that fat Indian aunty might have liked you for her son. How about your friends? Are they still with you now? May be some of them might have moved to another city. Leaving all the promises behind and some as always would be surely living those promises. Distance doesn't matter unless and until you both value and remember your friendship.
      You have always been a responsible and perfect child for your family. They love you from the start and I'm sure at that time too. Either they are not happy for you or they would be. I won't give myself any expectations. Whatever it is they still love you and not only them even the other people who always cared for you. 
       I know you are still an over thinker like me right now but let me add this, it gains you nothing. The things that are stressing me right now may not even matter to you at the time you are reading this. You have to get working for them and to achieve the best for you. 
      Never settle for less, you deserve more and better. Its never too late to start something new and opt for the risky path you always were scared of. Look at those scars on you, it makes you look more beautiful than I'm now. It shows your audacity that made you reach at this stage of life, the sign of not giving up. 
      When you read this I want you to remember that hope is a powerful thing, it allows you to look beyond what is currently going on - maybe struggle or pain. And see a future that is full of possibilities, joy, wonder, adventure. That’s what makes our lives so meaningful. So, hold on to hope. It paves the way for brighter days. 
      There's a quote that goes like this,
      "Do something today that your future self will thank for".
      So lets get going, What say?

    title: "Perfectionism: The golden handcuffs of life",
    category: "Dream",
    description: `"Every parent has a dream that one day their child will achieve everything that they were not able to do and thereby load them with lots of expectations and responsibilities.
      Growing up in an environment like this, the child slowly develops a feeling to do better than anyone else not for himself but just to please others, mainly his parents. His father says, "You see my child is working hard to become an Engineer because that's my dream. He never disappoints me and never will." 
      Unknown to failures, the child simultaneously climbs the ladder of his growth, which is a good thing I must say. 
      But only he knows that he's carrying a burden on his shoulder which is so heavy that its weighing him down emotionally and psychologically. 
      He cries for every small failure he gets, for every expectation he's not able to meet, he compares himself to others and cannot endure a person who tries to be better than him. 
      All every one can see from outside is a hardworking boy who's trying his best to make others happy. He's a typical good boy that every parent in today's world ever wants. Who is afraid, what if he fails and gets a indecisive future? If we put the matter in a nutshell, he's just trying to be perfect for his parents. He feels trapped but there's still a light of hope inside him to live freely.
      One day, his father asked him whether he chose a college for him or not. He paused for a moment to think."
      
      From the day one you are made to believe that if you're perfect then you'll see the results you want, its time to stop! 
      I know those evil voices behind your mind is telling you that "you're not good enough", " the person next to you see far more better than you" and "you're not even close to that sharma ji ka beta" .
      No matter how hard you try, if you'll always measure your happiness in terms of perfection then you are never going to achieve it. 
      Someone will always remonstrate with you about your weak points. Its their job, they will aim for that weakest point of your heart intentionally or unintentionally which will wrinkle it. 
      We often try to achieve the edited version of standards set by people on social media which can be personally damaging because we just run towards acquiring those unattainable personalities. 
      You have flaws, so do I and so does everyone. It depends on how one sees himself but irrespective of the circumstances learn to respect your own self. Strive for excellence not perfection, strive to embrace your imperfections and strive for that inner peace.
      My old self always used to think how useless and hopeless she was, perpetually made herself feel inferior in front of the world. Then one day my mother told me, "May god gift everyone a daughter like you." "Who wants a son If someone has you? "
      These are the moments and the people for whom we live for. There is always someone in your life who constantly pushes you to do best in a way which is not toxic. Learn to identify them and cut off the toxic ones to get peace in your life. Focus on the good, on the blessings, the love you get and God, he has a plan for everyone. 
       Always do remember the line, one step at a time. Focus on the present without comparing yourself to others. The person you think is the most physically attractive may be facing a emotional problem, the wealthiest person need not to be the healthiest one and coolest person does not always have to be the smartest. Once you get trapped in this circle of becoming perfect you'll never achieve the freedom. It's okay if you mess up, try it another way, I'll be there to cheer you up with this writing. 
      Someone once told me 'you matter because you exist and you exist because you matter.' 
      How about trying to be you for once?
      So that not only 'sharma ji ka beta' but 'you' will set more examples alongside others!
      "I have decided to work on my photography skills from now. I know you'll be disappointed right now, but not in the near future," answered the child.

      `Even the prettiest roses has thorns, the beautiful moon has patches, the mightiest trees stoops.
      the costliest glass breaks, 
      the tallest wall cracks, 
      They are not perfect, neither am I, and that’s ok!
      Even the successful person fails, the person’s beauty fades, 
      the happiest person cries, 
      the strongest person sighs. Don’t apologize, No one is perfect, neither am I, 
      and that’s ok!`,
